How to start?

First off, you cannot directly start with implementation of this automatic
reloading of JavaScript modules. Because for all of this to work, you want a
reactive engine; you're not going to implement this live JavaScript thing in
the usual way. So, first the engine, then reactive JavaScript.

But OTOH you want to be able to quickly test things while you're developing this
RvLog engine. A simple webpage + rollup bundler with a watcher should be
enough. You should import "rvlog", have some test setup, may be some primitive
UI on the webpage, some output.


Primary things to implement in RvLog:
---

1. Eager procedures.

You should be able to forcefully / eagerly / proactively do things.

In this example, data is written into a database "D":

```js
import * as rv, {v, _} from "rvlog";

let D = new rv.Database();


rv.procedure(() => {
  for (let info of getStudents()) {
    let stud = D.student(info.name);

    rv.add(
      stud,
      stud.age(info.age),
      stud.sex(info ? 'male' : 'female'),
      stud.department(info.faculty)
    );
  }
});
```

Procedures can query data and iterate over results:


```js
rv.procedure(() => {
  rv.add(
    D.student("Joe"),
    D.student("Joe").age(22)
  );

  // Is Joe a known student?
  rv.exists(D.student("Joe")) === true;
  // Is Joe a student of 20 years old?
  rv.exists(D.student("Joe").age(20)) === false;
  // Is Joe a student of 22 years old?
  rv.exists(D.student("Joe").age(22)) === true;
  // Is Bill a known student?
  rv.exists(D.student("Bill")) === false;

  rv.add(
    D.student("Bill").age(25),
    D.student("Jack").age(27),
    D.student("Andrew").age(20),
  );

  let criticalAge = 22;

  // Create D.student("name").isYoung(true|false) based on each student's age
  // and the global "criticalAge" parameter.
  rv.forEach(
    D.student(v`stud`).age(v`age`),
    ({stud, age}) => {
      rv.add(
        D.student(stud).isYoung(age < criticalAge)
      )
    }
  );
});
```


2. Interaction with SQL

SQL predicates are specially recognized in bodies, and are executed by translation into SQL. Consecutive goals that target RDBMS are grouped together.

```js
rv.deduce(something, [
  SQL.scs_frontoffice_fee(v`fo_fee`),
  rv.equal(v`fo_fee`.event_id, v`order`.event_id),

]);

```

```py
@rv.deduce(something)
def order_level_effective_fee(event_id):
    fo_fee = rv.Var()

    yield SQL.scs_frontoffice_fee(fo_fee)
    yield fo_fee.event_id == event_id
  ...
```


Caching (ORM-like) approach to SQL:

  Cache entities, hold on to identities with primary keys. Same as SQLAlchemy.
  Don't load all columns by default. Accumulate all requested DB loads, and
  then combine IDs with `table.pk IN (id1, id2, id3, ...)`. Also possible to
  refer to the DB directly (i.e. SQL query as part of another predicate
  inference).
